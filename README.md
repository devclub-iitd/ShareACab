## Description
Usually, after exams or when the mid-sem break begins, there is a large surge of people going back to their respective hometown by air/railways. This journey involves an initial travel where the person takes a cab to the IGI Airport or the New Delhi Railway station. A lot of times, people are forced to travel solo, if there isn't anyone he/she knows traveling at a similar time. Also, this leads to shortage of cabs nearby and increase in waiting time. Had there been a student of IIT-D with whom the cab could have been shared, the fares would also be split and the waiting time will also reduce. Another thing is that girls prefer not to travel alone in Cabs in Delhi, so that problem will also be solved by this app.
